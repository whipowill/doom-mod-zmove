# ZMove for Brutal Doom

A Brutal Doom mod for emulating Quake movement.

This is a patch of a mod created by [Ivory](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=65095) to make it compatible w/ Brutal Doom v21.11.3.  If you, like me, play a lot of these old FPS games, switching between them can be frustrating bc of the different movement physics.  This mod brings the movement of Quake to Doom.
